Throughout the development process, I learned the importance of effectively delegating tasks based on team members' strengths, which greatly improved our workflow. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience collaborating on a shared repository using GitHub, which was essential for version control and tracking our progress.

                            <strong>Swap Dash</strong> was developed for an FBLA competition during high school, with the goal of creating a puzzle-based platformer that challenged players through switch puzzles and timers. The game was designed to encourage players to beat high scores, providing a competitive yet fun environment. This project allowed me to delve deeper into game development, applying my programming knowledge while collaborating with artists and musicians to deliver a polished product for the competition.

                            This project taught me the importance of creating clean, reusable code to efficiently build game levels and mechanics. I also learned how to collaborate effectively in a team where everyone had different strengths—while I focused on programming, my teammates contributed significantly to the game's art and music. If I were to continue this project, I would add more levels and unique mechanics to further challenge players and <br>enhance replayability.

                            Working on Fatal Business taught me the value of integrating multiple game elements—such as weapon progression and immersive sound design—into a cohesive whole. I learned a lot about managing sound assets and working on game logic alongside a team. If we were to continue developing this game, I would focus on refining the level design, improving the fluidity of boss battles, and expanding the game's content to enhance both challenge and enjoyment.
