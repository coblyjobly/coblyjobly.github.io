                    <p>Hello! My name is Colby, and I am a senior at Florida State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Innovation. With a strong GPA of 3.6, I am deeply passionate about software development, game design, and environmental initiatives. My journey in game development began in high school, where I first started creating games, and this passion has driven me to pursue programming with the goal of crafting immersive experiences that captivate and engage players.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am diversifying my skill set through application development, which allows me to broaden my expertise beyond gaming. I actively enhance my skills through my involvement in student organizations and internships. As a Manager at New World Rides, I developed valuable troubleshooting and operational skills while creating a fun atmosphere for guests in a fast-paced environment. My role as Project Facilitator at the FSU Innovation Hub allows me to manage projects, mentor peers, and engage in innovative problem-solving through web development. Additionally, my experience as a Technical Support Consultant for Art District Real Estate has further honed my ability to work collaboratively and think creatively, enabling me to bring unique perspectives to my projects.</p>
                    <p>My current and past projects are detailed below.</p>
