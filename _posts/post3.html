                <p>As the Fall 2024 semester wraps up, it’s rewarding to reflect on the progress my team and I have made on <a href="../index.html#ourpatch" class="read-more-link">Our Patch</a> What began as an ambitious idea has become a platform aimed at promoting local sustainability through community-driven tools.</p>

                <p>This semester, we focused on building essential web development skills—a crucial step as many team members were new to the field. By mastering HTML, CSS, and Git, we established a solid foundation for collaboration and development.</p>

                <p>We’re proud to have launched key features such as an interactive map highlighting sustainability resources (e.g., recycling points, parks, EV charging stations, community gardens), a calendar for upcoming events, and informational pages on topics like invasive plants and recycling. These features embody our vision to make sustainability accessible to the Tallahassee community.</p>

                <p>Looking ahead to Spring 2025, we aim to enhance Our Patch by implementing verified organization accounts for event postings and user accounts for RSVPs and data logs. We also plan to strengthen community engagement by collaborating with local organizations and encouraging them to feature events on the platform</p>

                <p>Reflecting on this semester, I’m proud of how much we’ve accomplished. The combination of skill-building, collaboration, and a shared passion for sustainability has been key to Our Patch’s development. I’m excited to see how the project evolves in the months ahead, confident that our efforts will make a meaningful community impact.</p>
