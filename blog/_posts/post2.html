                <p>At the start of this semester, my team and I began the prelimary stages of our web application project, <a href="../index.html#ourpatch" class="read-more-link">Our Patch</a> (previously titled <em>Sustain-A-Hub</em>). During these foundational weeks, we’ve been focused on conducting thorough research to identify the core features necessary to make our project successful.</p>

                <p>Given that many of our team members are new to web development, we have dedicated significant time to building essential skills in HTML and CSS. This has been an invaluable learning experience for the team, as we work to establish a solid technical and structural foundation for our site.</p>

                <p>In parallel, we’ve also prioritized mastering version control through Git. This powerful tool has enhanced our ability to collaborate seamlessly, allowing team members to contribute simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. By implementing Git early on, we’ve cultivated a productive, collaborative environment that has streamlined our workflow.</p>

                <p>As we transition into the development phase, there’s a collective excitement about bringing <strong>Our Patch</strong> to life. This project represents a significant milestone for us, not only in terms of applying our technical knowledge but also in contributing meaningfully to local sustainability initiatives.</p>

                <p>Moving forward, we remain motivated to refine our project and dive deeper into the coding process. Seeing <strong>Our Patch</strong> evolve from concept to reality is incredibly inspiring, and I’m eager to witness the positive impact it will have on our community.</p>
