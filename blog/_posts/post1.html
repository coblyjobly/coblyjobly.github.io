                <p><strong>Empowering Innovation Through Seminole Innovators</strong></p>

                <p>In December 2022, I had the privilege of co-founding <strong>Seminole Innovators</strong> with my good friend Jacob Javor, in association with the Florida State University Innovation Hub. Our mission has always been to inspire individuals from diverse backgrounds to harness the power of new technologies. From the start, Jacob and I were determined that our organization would focus primarily on fostering projects, though we encountered challenges in motivating students to embark on their own initiatives.</p>

                <p>To learn more about me and my part in co-founding Seminole Innovators, watch my <a class="read-more-link" href="https://youtu.be/roqyvkpSAqw?si=4fyUCQ77GAyi8Y9W">Featured Innovator Talk (Youtube)<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.</p>

                <p>Through our experiences over the past couple of years, we discovered that one of the most effective ways to empower students to learn new skills was to leverage our status as an Affiliated Student Organization. This led us to create <strong>Project Facilitator internships</strong>, which allow dedicated individuals to manage projects and teach valuable skills that many students may not yet have encountered.</p>

                <p>I am grateful to have been hired as one of these Project Facilitators, where I initiated the <em>Sustain-A-Hub</em> project—a web application designed to connect users with sustainability organizations and events in Tallahassee. My fellow Project Facilitators are also making strides with their projects: Naya is developing <em>ParkSense</em>, an app aimed at enhancing accessibility for disabled parking, while Dion is creating a party game using Godot.</p>

                <p>It has been incredibly rewarding to provide these diverse opportunities to our members, and I am eager to see how each project evolves!</p>
